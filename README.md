# Forecasting-With-ARIMA-Model
This was for a forecasting competition at school. I decided to forecast the value of the S&P 500 index and the yield on the 10 year treasury note by using an autoregressive integrated moving average model

I used python to fit the ARIMA model and also utilized the python package "pandas_datareader" to import data directly from Yahoo Finance.
